# FirstTimeGoProjects


A list of small projects of me trying to learn Go. 

The projects are by no means production ready, they are intended to help me learn the fundermentals and concepts 
behind the language. 

That being said, if you do spot any errors or improvements please feel free to let me know

Thanks
